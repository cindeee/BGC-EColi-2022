**archived**: data backup.

**data**: contains targeted and untargeted metabolomic datasets from 3 biofluid samples (urine, faecal, serum). 

**code**: preprocess data (tidying, scaling) for multivariate and univariate analysis. 

**output**: includes plots and database for metabolite annotation for pathway analysis in metaboanalyst.
