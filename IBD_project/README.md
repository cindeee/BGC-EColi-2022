# Exploring metabolite biomarkers for IBD diagnosis 
For the sake of FYP, the scope focuses finding serum metabolite biomarkers from a cross-sectional study.
Here shows the metabolomic workflow, with serum samples for instance.

**archived**: data backup.
**data**: contains targeted and untargeted metabolomic datasets from 3 biofluid samples (urine, faecal, serum). 
**code**: preprocess data (tidying, scaling) for multivariate and univariate analysis. 
**output**: includes plots and database for metabolite annotation for pathway analysis in metaboanalyst.
